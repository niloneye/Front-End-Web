     This is a div. A div is used to divide things vertically down the page. Inside this div is a paragraph I copied from wikipedia about polar bears.
    <p>
     The polar bear is a hypercarnivorous bear whose native range lies largely within the Arctic Circle, encompassing the Arctic Ocean, its surrounding seas and surrounding land masses. 
     It is a large bear, approximately the same size as the omnivorous Kodiak bear.
    </p>
    <p>
    Because of expected habitat loss caused by climate change, the polar bear is classified as a vulnerable species. 
    For decades, large-scale hunting raised international concern for the future of the species, but populations rebounded after controls and quotas began to take effect.
    For thousands of years, the polar bear has been a key figure in the material, spiritual, and cultural life of circumpolar peoples, and polar bears remain important in their cultures. 
    Historically, the polar bear has also been known as the white bear.
